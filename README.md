A Database Server and its Client Software need to communicate with each other and they do this by establishing a database connection. While the client can send commands using the database connection, the server can reply to the client by sending the information asked. This database is stored on the secondary storage device or on magnetic or optical disks as single or multiple files. The information that is stored in these files can be used to retrieve records. 

A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a more interactive user interface that helps establish a user-friendly environment, unlike the command line operating system. The user interface is made to be visually appealing through colourful icons, buttons, images, scroll bars et cetera known as visual indicators.

NetBeans is a FOSS(free and open-source) integrated development environment widely used for java known for its powerful and easy to use GUI builder with drag and drop facility. NetBeans also supports other scripting languages such as javascript, groovy and PHP. An additional advantage to NetBeans is that it is cross-platform. It follows WORA(Write once, run anywhere). Any Operating system can have this platform installed. NetBeans can be installed only if the java development kit is available. I have used JDK 1.8 for installing NetBeans IDE 8.2.
